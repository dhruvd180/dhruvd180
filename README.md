### Hi there 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning Python, JS, HTML5, and CSS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Unity3D
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on advanced Python module creation.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with writing cloud to scratch.mit.edu from repl.it and hosting webservers to connect to Scratch cloud.
- 💬 Ask me about Python or HTML, CSS, and JS.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started using Github when the pandemic started.

Also, I am looking for ways to wake a REPL.it REPL externally, and also looking for webservers to host ☁Storage for some Scratch projects.
